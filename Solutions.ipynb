Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you **borrow my boat** and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these [scratchcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard) as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won.\"\n",

    "The almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds `79`, `14`, `55`, and `13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the almanac contains a list of **maps** which describe how to convert numbers from a **source category** into numbers in a **destination category**. That is, the section that starts with `seed-to-soil map:` describes how to convert a **seed number** (the source) to a **soil number** (the destination). This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number one by one, the maps describe entire **ranges** of numbers that can be converted.

This line means that the source range starts at `98` and contains two values: `98` and `99`. The destination range is the same length, but it starts at `50`, so its two values are `50` and `51`. With this information, you know that seed number `98` corresponds to soil number `50` and that seed number `99` corresponds to soil number `51`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line means that the source range starts at `50` and contains `48` values: `50`, `51`, ..., `96`, `97`. This corresponds to a destination range starting at `52` and also containing `48` values: `52`, `53`, ..., `98`, `99`. So, seed number `53` corresponds to soil number `55`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any source numbers that **aren't mapped** correspond to the **same** destination number. So, seed number `10` corresponds to soil number `10`.\n",
